# DIGIT RECALL GAME
This is a memory game that will boost your memory capacity and will push you to further limits.
It consists of a series of figures and matrixes sizes that contain digits you need to memorize 
and retrieve them later. You get feedback everytime you recall the figures and can set records
so you keep track of your progress. On to of that, you can set it according to your capabilities 
and increase the difficulty throughout your game journey.

## GAME NAMES
1. **DIGIT RECALL GAME:** This is the first game where you can set the amount of digits every figure will have; you can set the amount of figures you have to
recall and the correct attempts you allow yourself to have before jumping to the next figure ready to be recalled.

2. **REVERSE DIGIT RECALL GAME:** This is the second game that like the previous one allows you to set the amount of digits every figure has, but with other
different options like speed for instance, this can manage the speed of the blinking numbers as long as you have set the flash mode to _true_.
Unlike the first game you recall the figures from back to front (**reversed**).

3. **SUPER-RECALL-CULUS GAME:** This is the third and last of these series of games. It has concepts of the previous games, but the figures to recalled are
organized in squared matrices ranged from 3 x 3 up to 10 x 10 size. You have one minute to memorize all the numbers in the matrix and if you fail you can keep trying
by clicking the **"Hint"** button and you get a change to see the numbers withing one minute again.
