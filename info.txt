I will create a digit recall game that will allow me to improve my memory.
This game consists on recalling the figure and you have to type it bellow
and you'll get inmediate feedback. 

You can set the amount of digits the figure you'll be memorizing and
also you'll be able to set the amount of correct attempts you'll do so the number
disappear and another number shows up. 

The game will show the amount of figures you've recalled and also will save the amount 
of figures you recall in a ten minute span allowing you to break you're record, which
will be saved in localStorage. This way you'll know if you're improving and you can see
the time you've spent in your training!

The app will also save record of the amount of numbers you've recalled in one hour
